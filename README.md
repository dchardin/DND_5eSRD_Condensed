In this repository, we're taking the rich and immersive world of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition's System Reference Document (SRD) and distilling it down to its essence. Our mission is to transform the traditional SRD into a streamlined, efficient guide that retains the full depth of D&D gameplay while making it more accessible, understandable, and easy to use for players and Dungeon Masters alike.

Leveraging principles of technical writing, we aim to present the rules in a format that emphasizes clarity, brevity, and utility. This includes employing concise language, structured formatting, and pseudo-code for rule descriptions, ensuring that readers can grasp complex concepts at a glance. Our approach is designed to cater to both seasoned adventurers and newcomers embarking on their first quest, providing essential information and practical examples to guide gameplay.
